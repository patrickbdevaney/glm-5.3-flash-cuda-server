// topk_radix.h — single-CTA radix select. PORTED VERBATIM from ~/deepseek-v4-flash-0731-cuda,
// where it replaced four warp selection-sort top-k kernels (that repo's DECODE_LADDER.md item 1.2).
//
// It is reused here unchanged because the two properties it was built for are exactly the two this
// model's DSA indexer needs, and both are easy to get wrong:
//   * TIE-BREAK IS VALUE-DESCENDING, INDEX-ASCENDING, which is what torch.topk produces and what
//     the oracle in ref/gen_indexer.py was captured with.
//   * -0.0 IS CANONICALISED ONTO +0.0. `index_score` is a sum of relu terms times per-head weights
//     that CAN BE NEGATIVE, so it emits -0.0 routinely. Comparing raw bits would order -0.0 below
//     +0.0 and silently select different pools.
// The `DSV4_*` env arms below are kept as-is rather than renamed: this is a verbatim port, and a
// diff against the original is more valuable than tidy naming.
//
// WHAT IT REPLACES AND WHY. `k_topk_decode`, `k_topk_verify`, `k_topk_masked` (compressed_decode.cu)
// and `k_topk_offset` (indexer.cu) all run the same shape: `topk` sequential passes over the score
// row, one warp argmax per output slot, marking the winner `-1e30f` between passes. Item 1.1 spread
// that argmax across the 32 lanes that were already launched (14-28x), but the algorithm is still
// O(topk x T) work in T/32 x topk SEQUENTIAL steps -- at topk=512 and T=3072 (ctx 12,288, ratio 4)
// that is 512 dependent rounds of 96 strided loads each. 0.4 measured the survivor, `i:topk`, at
// **13.47 ms at ctx 12,288, slope 0.872 +/- 0.021 ms per 1000 context, 12.5 % of the context term**.
//
// This is O(T) work in a constant number of passes: an MSB-first 8-bit radix select finds the
// threshold, one gather collects the winners, one bitonic sort puts them back in order.
//
// BIT-EXACTNESS IS THE WHOLE DESIGN, not a property checked afterwards. `sparse_attn` sums the
// selected rows IN ORDER, so fp32 association makes the ORDER load-bearing, not just the set. Four
// things carry that:
//
//   1. THE COMPOSITE KEY. `comp(v,t) = (ord(v) << 32) | ~t`, where `ord` is the standard
//      order-preserving float->uint32 map. Sorting `comp` DESCENDING is exactly (value descending,
//      index ascending) -- which is what a serial ascending scan with a strict `>` produces, because
//      a later equal never displaces an earlier one. Because `~t` makes every composite distinct,
//      the radix select has NO ties to break and needs no equal-key special case: exactly `k_eff`
//      elements satisfy `comp >= threshold`, always.
//   2. ADMISSION IS THE ORIGINAL'S FLOAT COMPARE, `v > floorv`, evaluated in float and never through
//      the key. That matters for NaN: `NaN > best` is false so the originals can never select one,
//      but `ord(NaN)` is larger than every finite key and a key-space test WOULD select it. Scores
//      are relu sums and should not go NaN; "should not" is not a gate.
//   3. SIGNED ZERO IS CANONICALISED. `-0.0f == +0.0f` in the originals' compare, so they are a tie
//      and the lower index wins; but `ord(-0.0) < ord(+0.0)` as raw bits. `index_score` can emit
//      `-0.0` (relu gives exactly 0, times a negative head weight), so `ord` maps both to `+0.0`
//      first. Covered by a dedicated distribution in tests/gate_topk_radix.cu.
//   4. THE SENTINEL CONVENTION IS PRESERVED AT THE CALLER. This returns raw source indices, or -1
//      for a slot with no candidate left; each caller applies its own offset/threshold rule to that
//      exactly as before.
//
// It also drops the dynamic-shared-memory request entirely (item 1.4): the originals asked for
// ~4T bytes against a 48 KiB default limit and silently returned garbage above ~49k context. This
// uses a fixed ~7 KiB of STATIC shared memory whatever T is.
